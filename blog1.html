  <h1>What is great design</h1>
  <h6>2020-06-04</h6>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>What makes great great? This is the question I asked myself. I have learned and practiced design for almost 10 years from industrial product to digital product, from 3D product to 2D interface, from  business application to consumer application.What is the standard of great design and how can we achieve this? </p>

  What is the standard of great design and how can we achieve this?

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>From the <a class="link" href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design">article</a>, Dieter Rams asked himself : is my my design good? According to this question, he expressed his insight on ten principles of good design. 
<ul>
  <li>Good design is innovative.</li>
<li>Good design makes a product useful. </li>
<li>Good design is aesthetic. </li>
<li>Good design makes a product understandable. </li>
<li>Good design is unobtrusive. </li>
<li>Good design is honest.</li>
<li>Good design is long-lasting.</li>
<li>Good design is thorough down to the last detail.</li>
<li>Good design is environmentally-friendly.</li>
<li>Good design is as little design as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>From Steven Jobs' perspective, he aspired the designers to achieve the perfectness. In the apple design team, there is no ah-ha moment for designers, they worked hard day by day to shape their design to achieve the greatness. They tried difference combinations of design elements. They used a high-level design taste to judge the result. They conducted the design critique every week and helped designers polish their results day by day. That is their design process and how the greatness achieve.</p>

<p>From my design practice, if you want to design a great product in design perspective, you should have a good or even great design taste. The taste will help you to judge your results. Besides, you should own the patience to test the design and try all of the combination. There is one moment that you think it shapes and it is done. That is my design process and how I achieve the greatness of a product. Nevertheless, great products come from different forces. Designer should communicate with different contributors to achieve the final ship. This is not one in the battlement. Everyone is involved. </p>
